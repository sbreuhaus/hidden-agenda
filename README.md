# Hidden Agenda 

#About the App

We wanted to make an application that will allow users to save their favorite travel destination photos and locations. Instagram and twitter are great ways of finding new places but not a great way of saving information. So by using the flickr api and mapbox api,  we were able to append photos by search and then by using ruby on rails we were able to save it on our backend and reappend it to the saved page.  We also incorporated user authorization so users can have their own account on the app and go back to their saved travel photos. 

#Technologies used:

CSS,
